### Content

My motivation to study computer science extends further than my basic interests in technology. My dream is to become an engineer in building high-performance systems that can bear increasing demand of huge traffic.

Computing changed from being more than a hobby when I started at Southeast University in 2012. Influenced by fast pace of Internet technologies as well as its huge spread value, I can't wait to set my foot in building a website. I took part in a competition to develop an online answering system in my first year's college and won Best-Performance Prize. The charming place of web technologies is its beauty in effects as well as its ease in use. I managed to build my first website with all the basic functions done within two weeks. During that time, I came to know plenty of fascinating knowledge in making websites worked, including two of my favorite languages, Javascript and Python.

I love to delve deep. Unlike my peers, I continued to explore how to improve my site in performance. I tried to locate places which cost time longer than normal by printing logs in some key lines of codes and found that delay mainly happened when users fetched their problem list. There were two steps in a regular process, first is to get the problem-id list store in the database and next extract the detailed information, which is inevitable. Therefore, I focused on the optimization of the first step that I designed a function based on hash to generate the list, because I noticed that the relationship between users and problems is analogous to the feature of hash function, that one user always maps to a constant list and one list is allowed but not recommended to two users. This improvement increase the average response time of a certain API by one second, especially when users first entered the system for it also save time in storing the list. Besides, to further reduce the number of database calls, I store the past time in the memory instead of database by using Memcached service. Through this, I gained extremely large hands on experience in how to build high-performance system and sense of accomplishment prompt me to be a specialist in this area in the future.

In addition to concentrate on engineering, I dabbled in research as well. To underpin my foundation in computer science and fascinated by the Artificial Intelligence in the movie, I entered the lab sponsored by Associate Professor Ni who focused on computational intelligence and its applications. I led a group to explore the application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) on Robot Path Planning (RPP) and concluded the work into a paper published on CEC2015. In the paper, we discussed about the defect of applying classical ACO directly to solve RPP problem, proposed three specific strategies to improve the algorithm and gave convincing experiment results to prove the effectiveness. This experience told me that there was still a big margin of improvement in the performance of computing and strengthened my faith to do a correlated work.

I am the one who firmly believe opportunity never comes for us, but we should make itself. Exploring the best practice of high-performance system, the biggest obstacle is not technology but lack of real environment where I can test my code. With the thought of this, I found an internship in Microsoft to fill the gaps in the first semester of my senior. I was initially assigned to do the client side work, however, that was not my purpose here. In the next sprint, I proactively applied to the performance test group. The profession of the performance test system broadened my horizon as well as inspired me with many ideas about what I want to do in the future.

At Microsoft my internship extended further than pure programming. I learnt to keep work-life balance, such as playing foosball after lunch. I was the only intern who joined the Visual Studio China Basketball Team. This journey elevated myself both in technological and sociable level. Based on this unforgettable experience, I am willing to start my career in technology giants to build a firm foothold in the industry, including networking and self-improvement.

I apply for UCLA in two reasons. UCLA offers abundant education resources and has many excellent CS professors who are amazing at teaching. Courses, like Operating Systems Principles by Eggert and Algorithms in System Design/Architecture by Potkonjak, not only give huge boosts to me in understanding computer science, but also underpin the foundations for further job hunting. Besides, UCLA has a strong industry connection. Companies love UCLA because of its reputation for being academically rigorous and they also have a voice in curriculum planning. This means that I'll have a higher chance of getting that job from these big corporations because they know what is being taught here.

However, my career goal exceeds more than being a bolt on a big machine. Through years of experience accumulated, I want to set up my own startups with friends or lead a team in a relative small company. During the intership in Microsoft, I witnessed how a well-designed system facilitated developers. I could receive real-time report automatically when performance abnormal occurred and locate the congestion by simply typing some conditions to the query system. However, to me computing, both innovative and exciting, is a profession with unlimited boundaries. I dreamed of building a system which enhances the current automation in three phases: first, detect the particular lines of code which cause the congestions; second, gave constructive suggestions of optimization; finally, automatically improve the performance even with inefficient code.

Despite the growing responsibility, the startup provides me with larger space to exploit my talents in technology as well as a greater opportunity to turn ideas into products. Moreover, Los Angeles is becoming a new assembly point in California for startups due to the increasing land price of Silicon Valley. I can imagine that, with the international perspective and professional expertise developed at UCLA, I will bring my potential into full play in my future efforts to practice my dreams.
