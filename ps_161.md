# PS 16.1 MSIN## Briefly explain your objective in pursuing the master's degree(s) for which you are applying.The main reason I apply for the Master’s Degree in Information Networking is to gain a thorough understanding about how information systems are designed and have great economic value, which I think is an unique expertise in the future job hunting. The combination of information technologies and management has proved to be successful in the past ten years in business. Plenty of IT companies set up for they have followed the rules of such. As for me, the experience at Microsoft has strengthened my approval to the view. On the scrum meeting, my manager always guided me to explore the potential value of the functions. In a demand-driven development, I saw that the technology and management supplement each other. Sometimes, well-designed code architectures can result in meeting the potential needs of customers; meanwhile, deliberate demand analysis can also detect bugs in the system. After the internship, I generated some new ideas in this field and feel I’ve still got a lot of improving to do. The courses in MSIN are the best complements for me. In addition to those technology requirements, like Operating System Design and Implementation, which directly enhance my engineering ability, courses like Managerial Economics and Business Management are also very conducive for me because I can understand how economic theory works by solving actual problems. I believe MSIN is the ideal program where I can realize my full potential.## Describe your background in engineering, computer science, and other fields particularly relevant to your objectives. Include any industrial or commercial work experience.My overall technological skills improved significantly during my undergraduate career. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. In my first year in college, for example I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; in my sophomore year, I started to explore front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; I also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. Besides, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which cover a huge range of fields, are a record of the exploration I have made in software development.

At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was to publish documents from a git repository, relying heavily on GitHub service. Thanks to my acquaintance with it, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with GitHub, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At all-hands meeting, Open Publishing project got high praise and the work I have done was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.## Outline your research experience (if applicable).In my second semester of college, I set up a research project focusing on improving the recognition rate of human gestures. I applied several supervised Machine Learning algorithms to my system and tested their effectiveness for classifying gestures. Though the training data was not as large as it might have been, the improved method was indeed more accurate and more stable. This improvement elevated the project's status from college level to national level.

In the next semester, I entered Professor Qingjian Ni’s lab to do the research in Swarm Intelligence and started to act as a leader in the Project Robot Path Planning. We proposed an improved Ant Colony Optimization and published a paper on IEEE CEC 2015. In the algorithm, two heterogeneous feature ant colonies that were defined to perform as exploration and exploitation respectively were introduced to solve the premature problem. We tried to balance the population of two colonies based on the stagnate rate which was first proposed in MMACS. The experiment with other 5 comparative algorithms under 4 different-scale maps has proved the effectiveness of our method. In the research, I learnt not only a lot of knowledge in swarm intelligence, but also many useful skills in studying a new field, like standing on the shoulders of a giant. For example, when I first started to do research, besides plenty of classic literature, a repository on GitHub, Python-Ant-Colony-TSP-Solver, gave me a big help in programming the framework.
## Please describe any experiences where you have demonstrated leadership skills and abilities. These examples may include academic, professional, extracurricular and/or community activities. Also please identify any leadership qualities that you would bring to the INI that you believe would enhance and add to our community and reputation.I was not born as a leader. In the first competition in college, I set up a team, but ask one of my friends to be the leader. I was not sure that I could take the lead and was so afraid that teammates would blame me. However, during the developing, my advantage on technics and innovation convinced the team, and I also gained great confidence. At that time, I realized that maybe I can use my technical ability to solve problems in the team projects.

I tasted the happiness of collaboration in my next team project, where I introduced GitHub to my team. In the early stages of development, however, because of its unfamiliarity and alien interface, my teammates felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. However, with my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. As a result, we managed to program 30000 lines of code in two weeks, and our project won the First Prize.

After solving the problem of code management, I turned my attention to team collaboration. In the second summer vocation, I set up a five-people team to take part in a practical training. Every other day, I convened a scrum meeting, where every team member talked freely about what he had done, would like to do and his opinion on the current product. Although there was only one-month time to develop the product, I asked them patiently to spend 1 hour reviewing other people’s code everyday. Besides, I never joined discussion about technical details to give teammates the most space to exploit their potential.

I believe I have potential to understand and accept the ideas of engineers, and merge their forces to fight for the same goal. One of my colleagues at Microsoft told me that what a good team requires most was the identification of the respective differences. Under an international environment, this quality becomes more precious, and I feel confident that in MSIN I can use my leadership to set up interest groups or take part in hackathons.## Please provide any information you feel would be helpful to the admissions committee in making a decision. For example, explain any extenuating circumstances such as an illness that led to a bad semester on your transcript, etc.Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under my teacher's guidance , I was the youngest to reach the highest level in calligraphy.

My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into frequently developing fantastic ideas. For example, I was watching Arrow on YouTube, and felt uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because I accustomed to lying on a sofa, just like watching TV at home. So I decided to put my idea into reality by join in hackShanghai 2014, with an app on my smart phone controlling Chrome browser using an extension. My invention surprisingly won Second Prize in the hackathon, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic ideas could also have potential to come to fruition.

As I write this statement, another fantastic idea is coming to me. When I began writing, I asked Siri: 'What kind of students does CMU need?', and was surprised when only confusing and unexpected answers appeared. Perhaps there was no single right answer to this question, but it was interesting that Siri was unable to give any constructive advice. I thought to myself why Artificial Intelligence had failed to do so? It prompted my recollection of a similar experience at Microsoft. Working as a member in a team of developers whose product required high performance and stability, I received reports from the test team almost daily, complaining about how our service was slow or down. I wonder if an intelligent system can reduce all these drudgeries. With a well-designed learning algorithm, accompanied by a large bank of optimization records and corresponding automation solutions, perhaps someday this dream will become reality. I want to make my own contribution to develop the system, because the ability of software to help people drives my interest in Computer Science.## Detailed C programming and systems-level project Description:
I have programmed in C for 4 years, from high school to sophomore. Afterwards, I mainly worked on C++, Java and some dynamic languages.

I programmed an Instant Messenger in my first summer vocation at Southeast University. At that time, I was fully fascinated by the Linux, but I found that people who worked under Linux systems didn't have a suitable tool to communicate with others efficiently, so I decided to make one with my own hand. I tried to make the full software in C programming for the related modules and interfaces were all in a low level and I regarded performance as the main factor. I elaborately investigated the technology and searched for several mature solutions like using GTK as GUI, MySQL as Database and Socket as information transmission.

To make an Instant Messenger, client-side software and server-side service are both important. In my design, the information between clients is not retransmitted by the server, but directly sent to another client using UDP. By this smart design, the system can hold the connection of a much larger number of users in the same time without crashing the servers. However, the design is much more complicated in both coding and deploying.

At the server-side, I need to manage the user information and authorization information. When a client logged in, information about himself, his friends and groups need to be told; meanwhile, his IP address had to be updated. Whenever a client accessed the server, the service should first to catch its TCP connection, and create another thread to deal with this request in order to avoid blocking at the server-side. Besides, as a performance concern, user information was cached in memory by Memcached service to reduce the access of database.

In all of these server-side tasks, the most challenging one was to create a convenient and extensible Data Accessor for the stored data. C is a relatively low-level programming language compare to C++ or Java for its lack of sufficient abstract for the real-world things and the concept of object. In such case, I encapsulated several commonly used methods by using the C interface library for MySQL in a standard naming format, like GET_USERINFO_BY_ID. The straightforward naming constraints accelerated my further programming. The server-side code therefore became clean and readable, afterwards, it was successfully transferred to one of my partners.

In my design, the main business logic was executed on the every client. There were three main functions: first was the interaction with the server to get the information of other clients, like user information and online notification; second was the communication with other clients to support text and binary transmission; the last one was UI which should be independent from other execution threads to avoid blocking.

In the implementation of the first functions, I met a large problem. How can the client get the notification when his friend was online? There were two common solutions in solving the problem: one was that the server reserved a long socket connection with the client when a user logged in so that the client would receive any event as soon as it occurred; another was that the client sent heartbeat packets to the server every once in a while to get all the events in the past interval. Every solution had its pros and cons: in the first solution, the user experience would be better, but holding too many notification threads on a single server was not a good idea; in the second solution, the server would not afford such big pressure, but the event can’t be received in time. After analyzing the user scenario, I finally chose the second solution, because the event, such as the online notification, was not so necessary but the response time of the server is quite important. If the holding thread occupied too much resource, it would definitely slow the processing down, which was contrary to the original design.

In the second main function, what most blocked me was the multithread programming. It was the first time I programmed multithread software, so I experienced a very tough journey to understand what was blocking, semaphore and deadlock. However, it was worthwhile when I finally realized the whole multithread program by myself. In addition to the thread to send the heartbeat packets and the UI thread, there were two major threads: one to send information and another to receive. In the sending thread, information was first to be packaged as text or binary, then tagged with sender’s name and sending time, and delivered by the IP address we stored locally; or when the user was not online, we would store the information at the server (though it was an asynchronous action, but not a good idea by practice). In the receiving thread, the information received would be initially unpacked, and thrown to the GUI based on who the sender was and whether there was a corresponding active window.

The whole software was finished by three weeks. In the first two week, I programmed the infrastructure independently, and in the last week, three classmates help me to finish the GUI and end-to-end testing. Although what I learnt may not be concluded as best practice or experience, I do learnt a lot, like ‘which is better’, ‘what had better not follow’ and ‘why there is such an error message’ in C programming and engineering. I believe such an experience will guarantee my performance in MSIN study.
## Detailed C++/Java Project Description:I began to program Java in my third semester at Southeast University. Now, though I may not use Java to develop large-scale software projects, I still sometimes program some Android Apps by myself for fun and practice.

My first team project written in Java was a restful web API server. I set up a five-people team to take part in a practical training held by the college. We decided to build a web live platform to give everyone to share his moments. In the platform, in addition to the live service, the website itself had all the attributes of a social network. Considering that a clean separation of frontend and backend was conducive to both performance and developing, I proposed the technic solution of using Angular.js and Jersey to support the whole website, which was accepted by my teammates. Due to our innovation and unexpected developing speed, we got the second in the training, and broadcast the whole final presentation on our website.

There are four parts in our system: resources, models, accessors and listeners. Resources are to expose the interface to outside visitors, models are the entities in tables, accessors encapsulate some common methods to operate the database, and listeners regulate tasks triggered by events or clocks.

In the resource level, I defined most of the interfaces by Jersey’s notation methods. Also in these methods, I programmed to check the parameters’ validation, convert the context to our model and pass it to the model level.

When the request reached the model level, models executed the corresponding actions, like searching a live or adding a user. It called the accessors to do several queries to the database, and gave back the result. There were also something executed asynchronously, and in this time, the listener was triggered, added the task to the queue, and invokes it when the time was up. In the first week, I wrote some samples of the whole flow, and transferred the work to one of my teammates.

In my junior, together with two students in Electronic Engineering, I took part in an Embedded System development contest. In the past five years, wearable device was getting more and more popular, especially in the fitness, so we decided to build a smart device based on a microcomputer to counting pushups. Our design was to use the gyroscope to measure the degree, and then send the data to a mobile app by Bluetooth for further processing.

I was responsible for programming the Android mobile app. During developing, I used a PullToRefresh ListView to show the found device so that the user could choose his device to connect. When the asynchronous searching began, another thread was created to start a countdown to prevent too long waiting time. Similarly, if Bluetooth found the available device in time, it added the device to an ArrayList that bound to the ListView and stop the countdown. Once the connection was established, the information can be transmitted freely by two sides.

In two Java projects, my programming ability and engineering quality improve immensely. I start to program a whole application with good readability in code, extensibility in architecture and maintainability in deploy, instead of writing one piece of code. I believe that the broadened horizon in the software world and my passion in coding can secure my performance in MSIN.
