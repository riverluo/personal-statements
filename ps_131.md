# PS 13.1 Stanford

Curiosity is human's original motivation to explore the world. I have developed variety of hobbies since my childhood, such as calligraphy, the game of go and sketching. Among them, calligraphy is the longest hobby I've stuck with as well as the deepest I have understood. During my ten-year practice, I found every different writing style had its own way to be aesthetic. Sometimes, I had to be soft and slow to keep it in order; while sometimes, I must to be fast and energetic to show its power. When I tried multiple writing styles on one poem to find the best, I learnt more knowledge on how to write a perfect calligraphy work, making me the youngest to reach the highest level under the guidance of my teacher.

Out of the nature to explore new things, my technology stack grows wide in my undergraduate. Different kinds of repositories in my Github are the direct result of my diverse learning trace. For example, during my first year in college I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore, I started to be interested in the front-end development, taking advantage of the cutting-edge front-end framework like Angular.js; I was fond of developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting the number of my push-ups. These projects, which hardly belong to the same field, recorded my exploration and trial in software development, giving me a general outlook to the world of software.

Being interested in so many various areas is a gift as well as a burden, so I developed a quick and effective way to digest those knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on Github and other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

Maybe for the curiosity, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. Once I was watching Arrow on Youtube, I felt super uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because what I imagine was that I was lying in a sofa, just like watching TV at home. I turned this into reality in a hackathon with an app in my smart phone controlling Chrome by an extension. This invention surprisingly won the Second Prize in the competition, and that small thing moved me for I realized that sometimes only fantastic idea could have such strong power.

Now, another fantastic idea is forming in my mind. When I started to write this article, I asked Cortana a question 'What kind of student does Stanford need?'. Clearly it provided me with many confusing answers I don't expected, or perhaps the question even don't have a right answer, but basically Cortana can offer some constructive advice. I asked myself why Artificial Intelligence couldn’t give me the right answer? This recalls my similar experience at Microsoft. I was working as a member and developer in a team, whose product required high performance and stability, so almost everyday we received report from the test team, complaining about how our service is slow or even down. I can't help but wonder what if all the drudgery could be done with programs. In my imagination, the system could be developed in three levels: first, the system would detect the particular lines of code that cause congestion due to performance test; next, it can give advice or hints on how to optimize it manually; at last, the intelligent system would automatically transform the low-efficiency high-level language to the fast machine language.

Unlike other fantastic ideas I had before, I know that this time is quite different. Following my experience in research, if I am going to make my idea come true, there are plenty of things to learn. Stanford has the state-of-art Artificial Intelligence technology and education resource in the world, which can help me overcome the difficulty of joining halfway. In Stanford, I can also meet students who share the same interest in AI with big imagination, realizing ideas togther.

The program’s well-design curriculum setting, companied with top quality courses in Stanford, is another bigg appeal to me. To get full preparation for my graduate study, I have made a possible study plan, based on my current knowledge and interests of Artificial Intelligence. In Requirement 1, I look forward to consolidating my foundation of computing, for example, in Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Design and Analysis of Algorithms; similarly, in Requirement 2, Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques is a huge boost to me, who is ready to plunge myself in this field. I prefer single depth in Requirement 3 to have more credits to focus on what I love, so in the available 27 credits, I intend to choose Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding to strengthen my understanding in how modern quantitative techniques applied in NLP; Social Information and Network Analysis will provide me with some key insights into how to analyze large-scale network data and reason it. Beside these application-oriented courses, Machine Learning, a course to introduce the general methods in the field, should also prove valuable. As for the other credits, I would like to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons in AI by Decision Making under Uncertainty, Mining Massive Data Sets and Algorithmic Game Theory. Research Project in Artificial Intelligence will test my ability of solving real-world problems by AI methods learnt during my graduate study.

After graduation, I want to bring what I learn and gain in Stanford to the industry, because after all, I am solving a real-world problem and its audience is the general public. Breadth Course is a great advantage for me to find a position in firms. Following my interview experience at Microsoft, where I found interviewers like to set practical problems they encountered in their own jobs, to be solved using commonly used algorithms, Data Structures and The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox should be very conducive to me. Through Functional Systems in Haskell, I can learn a totally different programming language and its philosophy in a systematic way, giving me more choice to solve technical problems met in the future.

Considering that Stanford’s reputation for being academically rigorous, the high-payload courses will be a big challenge for me, but it will also be the opportunity to become better. With all I have investigated, I therefore feel confident that Stanford is the place where I can realize my full potential through my future efforts.
