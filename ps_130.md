# PS 13.0 Stanford

July. 15th, 2013 was a day to remember for me, because on that day, I made the wise decision to join Github, the biggest worldwide open-source community. Looking back now, I have learnt nearly everything I need to become a qualified software engineer from this community. What it has given to me has exceeded my expectations beyond all measure.

The Github community provided me with a quick and effective way to learn. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on Github. Other developers would leave comments to help me improve the quality of the code, and then I would optimize it according to their advice. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, my programming ability has improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month of joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

Through Github, I also tasted the happiness of collaboration in my team project, where I introduced it to my team. In the early stages of development, however, because of its unfamiliarity and alien interface, my teammates felt reluctant to use it, even thinking that it would slow the progress down. However, with my sincere insistence and patient instruction, they gradually began to embrace it. I was very satisfied that for the first time my partners and I achieved such good cooperation. Our development speed rose exponentially for parallel working, and we managed to program 30,000 lines of code in two weeks, our project winning the First Prize.

After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. However, the most important thing I have gained is not the enhancing of my abilities, but rather my learning the spirit of Open Source. This is something that has influenced me deeply in every respect.

The Spirit of Open Source is a spirit of sharing. Academic research is still a relatively closed field, but things are starting to change. There is a growing trend for researchers to open source experiment data on Github, offering solid proof for their results. In the meantime, more and more open-source implementation of theoretical methods is appearing, popularizing abstruse knowledge, as with A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Python. These breakthroughs were highly conducive to the development of Computer Science. When I started to do research on Ant Colony Optimization, an open-source implementation on Github gave me a big help in programming the framework of the algorithm, and afterwards, to make my own contribution, I have also put my improved algorithms and experiment data in a public repository. Maybe someday, these simple gestures will be of benefit to those in need.

The Spirit of Open Source is also a spirit of involvement. At Microsoft, I worked as a member and developer in the Open Publishing Team, whose product was an end-to-end automation solution for publishing documents from a git repository, relying heavily on the Github site. Thanks to my acquaintance with the community, I soon became the driving force in the team. During my six-month internship, I was involved in every aspect of the project relating to interactions with Github, but the huge amount of work did not beat me down, as I gained energy from doing what I love. At our all-hands meeting, the Open Publishing project won high praise from our department head, and the work I have accomplished was demoed by my manager, receiving a very warm response from the audience.

Despite my extensive study in the open-source world, I had to admit what I saw at Microsoft broadened my horizons. I come to understand the key role software engineering played in helping this huge machine to run quickly and stably. I also realize how the open-source community is a perfect fit for these huge companies. Technology giants take advantage of open-source technology, refine it to solve real-world problems, and then give back what they have achieved to build a thriving community.

With these experiences in hand, my career ambition is to become a researcher in a major technology company, contributing code for exciting projects in the open-source community as well as putting its technology into profitable production. I heard about this specific job on an open-source community session, when a researcher from Huawei who specialized in applying Spark to the huge data processing shared his work, and I became completely fascinated.

The program’s well-design curriculum setting, companied with top quality courses in Stanford, is the biggest appeal to me. To get full preparation for my graduate study, I have made the possible study plan, based on my current knowledge and interests of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In Requirement 1, I look forward to consolidating my foundation of computing, for example, in Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Design and Analysis of Algorithms; similarly, in Requirement 2, Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques is a huge boost to me, who is ready to plunge myself in this field. I prefer single depth in Requirement 3 to have more credits to focus on what I love, so in the available 27 credits, I intend to choose Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding to strengthen my understanding in how modern quantitative techniques applied in NLP; Social Information and Network Analysis will provide me with some key insights into how to analyze large-scale network data and reason it. Beside these application-oriented courses, Machine Learning, a course to introduce the general methods in the field, should also prove valuable. As for the other credits, I would like to enrich my knowledge and broaden my horizons in AI by Decision Making under Uncertainty, Mining Massive Data Sets and Algorithmic Game Theory. Research Project in Artificial Intelligence will test my ability of solving real-world problems by AI methods learnt during my graduate study.

Breadth Course is a great advantage for me to find a position in firms. Following my interview experience at Microsoft, where I found interviewers like to set practical problems they encountered in their own jobs, to be solved using commonly used algorithms, Data Structures and The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox should be very conducive to me. Through Functional Systems in Haskell, I can learn a totally different programming language and its philosophy in a systematic way, giving me more choice to solve technical problems met in the future. Considering that Stanford’s reputation for being academically rigorous, the high-payload courses will be a big challenge for me, but it will also be the opportunity to become better. With all I have investigated, I therefore feel confident that Stanford is the place where I can realize my full potential through my future efforts.
