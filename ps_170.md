## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is what underpins the human instinct to explore the world. Of many hobbies I developed as a child, the one that most inspired me was the art of calligraphy. Ten years into my calligraphy practice, I appreciate that every writing style has its own aesthetics. Some styles are fast, energetic and powerful; others remain soft, slow and orderly. When I write a Tang poetry with multiple styles, I learn how to perform a perfect calligraphy work. Under the guidance of my teacher, I was the youngest student to reach the highest level in calligraphy.

It was this same innate curiosity and exploration that I sought out in the calligraphy practice that I have applied to improving my technological skills. Different repositories in my GitHub are evidence of the diverse learning paths I have followed. For example, during my first year of college I have programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore I have taken an interest in front-end development, taking advantage of cutting-edge frameworks, such as Angular.js; and during this time, I have also enjoyed developing Android apps to facilitate activities in my daily life, like counting my morning push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. In addition, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which span multiple fields, have served as a record of the exploration I have made in software development, together giving me an excellent overview of the software world.

My vast interest repertoire has been a gift, as well as a challenge. In order to entertain my intellectual recreations, I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged further in the activity, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals adequately. Through this unique mode of learning, my passion for programming developed and my coding skills were enhanced. For example, in the beginning of my internship I would modify my code 5-7 times before final refinement, but within a single month, this figure was reduced to two iterations.

Curiosity alone has fostered my development of and incursion into frequently developing fantastic ideas. For example, I was watching Arrow on YouTube, and felt uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because I accustomed to lying on a sofa, just like watching TV at home. So I decided to put my idea into reality by participating in hackShanghai 2014, with an app on my smart phone controlling Chrome browser using an extension. My invention surprisingly won Second Prize in the hackathon, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic ideas could also have the potential to come to fruition.

As I write this statement, another fantastic idea is coming to me. When I began writing, I asked Siri: 'What kind of students does Columbia need?', and was surprised when only confusing and unexpected answers appeared. Perhaps there was no single right answer to this question, but it was interesting that Siri was unable to give any constructive advice. I thought to myself why Artificial Intelligence had failed to do so? It prompted my recollection of a similar experience at Microsoft. Working as a member in a team of developers whose product required high performance and stability, I received reports from the test team almost daily, complaining about how our service was slow or down. I could not help but wonder if Machine Learning could reduce all these drudgeries. With a well-designed learning algorithm, accompanied by a large bank of optimization records and corresponding automation solutions, perhaps someday this dream will become reality. I want to make my own contribution to the realization of Machine Learning solutions, because it is this ability of software to help people in their lives and jobs that drives my interest in Computer Science.

Columbia has the world-class education resource in Machine Learning, and to prepared myself fully for graduate study, I have made an academic plan, based on the current development of my knowledge. Within the Machine Learning track, Introduction to Computational Learning Theory will broaden and strengthen my understanding of theoretical foundation of Machine Learning; Advanced Machine Learning will teach me modern approaches utilized in Machine Learning, which directly improve my insufficient background in the field. Besides, I intend to enrich my knowledge and expand my perspectives in course including Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Bayesian Models in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Analysis of Algorithms II.

In addition to making full use of education resource in campus, I have a bigger plan in my graduate study. Following my interview experience at Microsoft, huge companies warmly welcome star programmers or those who have a voice in any technological field. For my love to open-source technology, I intend to become a contributor of some famous open-source projects on GitHub related to Machine Learning, like scikit-learn, which is warmly discussed and wide used in industry, and through such training, I can practice skills and gather experience for my career.

After obtaining my Master’s degree from Columbia, I intend on applying what I learnt into industry, turning cutting-edge Machine Learning technologies into pragmatic products. If possible, I would like to secure a position as a data analyst at Google. At the awards ceremony of the Google Excellence Scholarship 2015, I was completely fascinated by work shard about how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting a movie's box-office revenue, which had become very common in this company. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, and in areas such as these I can utilize my talent in Machine Learning while also fulfilling my dream of making better Artificial Intelligence.

I look forward to furthering my Computer Science studies at Columbia and I believe that it is the place where I will realize my full potential.
