# PS 12.1 MCDS## The application requires a personal essay. What makes a good essay?We are looking for strong evidence that you can do well in our degree program. For example, a description of your research project experience, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. A description of a large software project, your involvement in the project and the impact of the project is good evidence. A historical essay that starts with your first use of computers at age five is not good evidence. Please write the essay yourself. Get help of course, but it should be substantially your own words.## Statement of Purpose'Come on, guys, see what we have made!' A shout broke the silence in the classroom where most students from the first pilot class in science and technology innovation in Shanghai were busy preparing for China Adolescents Science & Technology Innovation Contest. The shout was given by my partner and we have just finished the final round of test for our project, a system which recognized human gestures to play simple games. My classmates gathered around our working table, rushing to try 'Doodle Jump' in front of a camera. While I, as the creator of this software, sat on the side and witnessed my work bringing happiness to people, with pleasure and a sense of accomplishment.Curiosity is human's original motivation to explore the world. While the project won the First Prize, the system is far from perfect. I found that the recognition rate of gestures was low, even when only four candidates need to be recognized, because I programmed the judgment principles in a hard-code way. I realized that it was clearly a classification problem, but I can't figure out a way to improve, until I got in touch with some course related to Machine Learning, such as Big Data Processing. During the class, my group discussed the Apriori Algorithm, a classic data mining algorithm, and its application in practice. To strengthen my understanding, I designed the experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm with the voting data of American Congress, and concluded the work into a small paper. The careful preparation not only let me gain 91 in this course, but inspired me to re-design the classification algorithm in that system as well. I set up a new research project focusing on improve the recognition rate of human gestures in sophomore. I applied a simple Machine Learning algorithm, KNN, to my system and tested its eligibility of classifying gestures. Though the training data is not so large, the improved method proved to be more effective and stable. 
Teamworking is a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. To know more about how to do it in practice, I read the book 'Machine Learning in Practice', which was recommended by my advisor. Four of the students in the lab read the separate part of the book, and shared what we read and learnt every week. My knowledge in this field was enriched quickly through a unique mode of learning. As I engaged in this activity further, I has been totally attracted by Machine Learning because I found that it was gradually becoming a unique skill set in very high demand as more companies move forward to large data solutions.
Out of the nature to explore new things, my technology stack grows wide in my undergraduate. Different kinds of repositories in my GitHub are the direct result of my diverse learning path. For example, during my first year in college I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore, I started to be interested in the front-end development, taking advantage of the cutting-edge framework, such as Angular.js; I was fond of developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting the number of my push-ups. These projects, which hardly belonged to the same field, recorded my exploration and try in software development, giving me an overview of the software world.Maybe for the curiosity, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. When I started to write this article, I asked Cortana a question 'What kind of students does CMU need?', and it clearly provides me with many confusing answers I didn't expect. Perhaps the question never had a right answer, but basically Cortana can offer some constructive advice. I asked myself why the Machine Learning technology behind it was not strong enough to answer these questions? The question reminds me of a similar experience at Microsoft. I worked as a member and developer in a team whose product required high performance and stability, so almost every day we received reports from the test team, complaining about how our service was slow or even down. I can't help but wonder what if Machine Learning could reduce the drudgeries? By a well-design learning algorithm, companied with a large amount of optimization records and its automation solutions, maybe someday, everything will come true. I want to make my contribution to the direction because it has always been a dream since I first learnt to program. Let programs better help people's life and work, giving them abilities to assist us.In the field of Machine Learning, I am still a green hand, but I look forward to becoming better. The Master of Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University is apparently my first choice for its concentrated effort to cultivate professional experts in Data Science. To get full preparation for my graduate study, I made a academic plan based on my current knowledge. I intend to consolidate my foundation in Machine Learning in a systematic way, for example, in Machine Learning and Machine Learning with Big Data Sets; I would like to select Design and Engineering of Intelligent Info Systems and Search Engines to broaden my horizons in the application of Machine Learning; with a growing demand of mining online videos, Large-Scale Multi-media Analysis should also prove valuable. In the 12 credits of electives, with the abundant Computer Science education resource in CMU, I want to enrich my knowledge by Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures, Operating System Design and Implementation and Compiler Design.After graduation, I want to bring what I learnt at CMU to the industry, turning the cutting-edge Machine Learning technologies into products. The employment advantage of the program is beyond words, so I never concern my finding a job, but how to better use my expertise developed at CMU. If possible, I want to position myself as a data analyst in Google in the future. On the award ceremony of Google Excellence Scholarship, a researcher shared his work of how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting the box-office of a movie, which was getting common in Google, and I was completely fascinated. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, where I can exploit my talent in Machine Learning.With all I have investigated, I therefore feel confident that MCDS is the ideal program to allow me to realize my full potential through my future efforts.
