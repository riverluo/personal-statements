# PS 15.3 UCI

## Requirement

Applicants for our graduate programs are selected using a holistic evaluation system. This essay will assist both the admissions committee and fellowship review committees to evaluate your preparation for the proposed field of study. In your statement of purpose, please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization.

A sample of topics that you might address in your statement is below. However, please structure your statement in any way that you feel best represents your research interests. Please do note that there is a 1200 word maximum for the statement.

- Academic plans and research interests
- Relevant experience
- Future career goals
- Why UC Irvine would be a good intellectual fit for you

This "Statement of Purpose" is required for all applicants and is different from the "Personal History Statement" that is also required for all applicants who are US Citizens or legal US Permanent Residents. The "Statement of Purpose" is expected to focus on your academic/research experiences and interests while the "Personal History Statement" should focus on your personal background.

In addition to the "Statement of Purpose" and "Personal History Statement", some academic programs require applicants to provide a writing sample. Applicants will be notified about any such requirements by their program and will submit any additional items separately and directly to the program. Check with your department about any such additional requirements.

## Statement of Purpose

Curiosity is human's original motivation to explore the world. Since my childhood, I have developed variety of hobbies, such as calligraphy, the game of go and sketching. Among them, calligraphy is the longest hobby I've stuck with as well as the deepest I've understood. During my ten-year practice, I found that every different writing style had its own way to be aesthetic. Sometimes, I had to be soft and slow to keep it in order; while sometimes, I must be fast and energetic to show its power. When I tried to apply multiple writing styles to one poem, I learnt more knowledge on how to write a perfect calligraphy work, making me the youngest to reach the highest level under the guidance of my teacher.

Out of the nature to explore new things, my technology stack grows wide in my undergraduate. Different repositories in my GitHub are the direct result of my diverse learning path. For example, during my first year in college I programmed an IM tool in pure C, using basic socket communication; since my sophomore, I started to be interested in the front-end development, taking advantage of the cutting-edge framework, such as Angular.js; I was fond of developing Android apps to facilitate my daily life, like counting the number of my push-ups. After two years' consistent effort, I now have 26 original repositories and more than 300 contributions on 12 open-source projects. Besides, my technology blog on github.io has been visited more than 5000 times. These projects, which hardly belonged to the same field, recorded my exploration and try in software development, giving me an overview of the software world.

Being interested in so many various areas is a gift as well as a challenge, so I developed a quick and effective way to digest knowledge. During my internship at a startup, I contributed code by opening pull requests to the company's repositories on GitHub and other developers left comments to help me improve the quality of the code. As I engaged in the activity further, I gained confidence to argue with the commenters and question their proposals. Through this unique mode of learning, I found the passion of programming and my coding skills have improved immensely. To begin with, I typically needed to modify my code between five to seven times to reach its final refinement, but within one month after joining the company, the figure reduced to just two iterations.

Maybe for the curiosity, I belong to those who frequently emerge fantastic ideas. Once when I was watching Arrow on YouTube, I felt super uncomfortable sitting in the chair, because what I imagine was that I was lying in a sofa, just like watching TV at home. I put it into reality in a hackathon with an app in my smart phone controlling Chrome by an extension. This invention surprisingly won the Second Prize in the competition, and the unexpected happiness moved me for I realized that fantastic idea could have strong power as well.

Now, another fantastic idea is forming in my mind. When I started to write this article, I asked Cortana a question 'What kind of students does UCI need?', and clearly it provided me with many confusing answers that I didn’t expect. Perhaps the question never had a right answer, but basically Cortana can offer some constructive advice. I asked myself why Artificial Intelligence failed to do that for me? The question reminds me of a similar experience at Microsoft. I worked as a member and developer in a team, whose product required high performance and stability, so almost every day we received reports from the test team, complaining about how our service was slow or even down. I can't help but wonder what if the drudgeries could be reduced by programs? By a well-design Machine Learning algorithm, companied with a large amount of optimization records and its corresponding automation solutions, maybe someday, everything will come true. Therefore, I want to make my contribution to the direction because it has always been a dream since I first learnt to program that letting programs better help people's life and work, and giving them abilities to assist us.

In the field of Machine Learning, I am still a green hand, but I look forward to becoming better. UCI has the world-class education resource in Machine Learning, which can help me overcome the difficulty of joining halfway. I plan to study Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to consolidate my foundation in this field; similarly, as the main method to construct modern information intelligent systems, Machine Learning should also prove valuable.

UCI is indeed great for Machine Learning and so are the professors in the field. Among all professors, I prefer to study under the guidance of Professor Pierre Baldi, whose interest covers a wide range in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Also his research aims to deal with the real-world problems in Natural Science, which parallels my understanding to Computer Science Technology.

After graduation, I want to bring what I gain in UCI to the industry, turning the cutting-edge Machine Learning technologies into products. Computer Science students at UCI are blessed to have a wealth of employment opportunities. Despite the career fair once per quarter, ZotLink is the most professional one in all the career center I have seen, which helps students find their internships or jobs in every detail. Besides, Southern California is touted as the next technology hub. A lot of startups are coming up in the greater Los Angeles area, and offices of many technology giants are being set up here, such as Google, which has started their Irvine office in 2014. If possible, I want to position myself as a data analyst in Google in the future. On the award ceremony of Google Excellence Scholarship, a researcher shared his work about how to use the world's largest data set to do cool things, like predicting the box-office of a movie, which was getting common in Google, and I was completely fascinated. Google also holds the best translation system in the world, where I can exploit my talent in Machine Learning and fulfill my goal of making a better Artificial Intelligence.

Orange County is a great place to live in and like most of coastal Southern California has an enviable Mediterranean climate. I look forward to further my study in Irvine and I therefore feel confident that UCI is the place where I can realize my full potential through my future efforts.
